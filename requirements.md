# AI-Powered Dubbing Application – Requirements

## 1. Project Overview
The AI-Powered Dubbing Application is a software solution that automatically converts video or audio content from one language into another using Artificial Intelligence.  
The goal is to remove language barriers and make digital content accessible to a global audience.

## 2. Problem Statement
Most online video content is available only in a single language.
Manual dubbing is expensive, time-consuming, and requires professional voice artists.
Due to these limitations, small content creators, educators, and organizations are unable to reach a wider audience.

This project provides an AI-based dubbing system that:
- Converts speech to text
- Translates text into the desired language
- Generates natural-sounding AI voice output
- Synchronizes the dubbed audio with the original video

---

## 4. Functional Requirements
- Users should be able to upload video or audio files
- The system should detect and extract speech from the media
- Users should be able to select the target language
- The system should generate dubbed audio using AI
- The final dubbed output should be downloadable

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- The system should be easy to use
- Processing should be reasonably fast
- The application should handle files securely
- The system should be scalable for multiple users

## 6. Target Users
- YouTube content creators
- Online educators
- Media and OTT platforms
- Government and awareness campaign teams
